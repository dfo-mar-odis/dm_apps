            Hi {{ pp.first_name|nmissing }},
        </p>
        <p>
            This email is to thank you once again for your application to the {{ object.project.full_name }}
            regarding your project: “<b>{{ object.title }}</b>” and to provide you with additional information on the development of
            your {{ object.project.abbrev }}
            Contribution Agreement (CA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The release of {{ object.program.abbrev }} funding is contingent on the development of a CA that includes a detailed work plan
            and budget consistent with {{ object.program.abbrev }} funding requirements. This includes maintaining other sources of support,
            to meet the program’s stacking requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            To facilitate the development of your {{ object.program.abbrev }} CA, DFO will develop a draft of the agreement based on the
            information and budget in your proposal. I hope to provide you with a draft in the coming weeks. If there have been changes to
            your project (e.g., in your budget) since your application was submitted please inform me as soon as possible to ensure that
            these are reflected in the draft CA. Once you have received the draft, you will need to review Schedule 5, which contains the
            details of your project’s activities and budget for accuracy and feasibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to expedite the process, I will fill in as much information as possible into Schedule 5 based on the information you
            provided in your proposal. I will indicate directly in the Schedule 5 if I need clarification on items and/or if I need
            additional information. To assist you with the Schedule 5, I’ve also re-attached your Application Form. Should you require
            guidance on the completion of Schedule 5, please contact me by email or at the phone number provided below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going forward, I will be your DFO contact for the development of your CA. Please let me know as soon as possible if your project
            or organization has time sensitivities or other factors that require a CA draft to be completed by DFO in a shorter timeframe
            and I will do my best to accommodate.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, please contact me with any questions or concerns you might have.
        </p>
